# Stroke Prediction with Classification Methods

Stroke is a life-threatening disease that ranks as the third leading cause of death worldwide. It occurs when brain cells die due to oxygen and nutrient deficiency. This project presents a comparative analysis for classifying stroke cases using a minimal set of attributes. The dataset comprises 76 attributes, including the class attribute, collected from 1025 patients in the USA, Canada, and Switzerland. However, this analysis focuses on a subset of 5111 observations and 11 columns. Various classification algorithms, including Decision Trees (DT), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest, are employed to predict pre-stroke independence at 6 and 18 months. This prediction considers sociodemographic and clinical characteristics and aims to identify differences between countries.

## Project Overview

This project uses machine learning classification techniques to predict stroke cases with a minimal set of attributes, ultimately contributing to early stroke detection and better patient outcomes.
